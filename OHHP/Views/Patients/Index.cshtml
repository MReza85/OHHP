@model  IEnumerable<OHHP.Models.Patient>

@*
    +    Note: I've set the model for this view to IEnumerable<Patient>.
    +    This is a simple interface implemented by the list class. Since
    +    in this view we only want to iterate over this list, and we don't
    +    need any of the operations in the List class (eg Add, Remove, etc),
    +    it's better to use the IEnumerable interface, which allows use to
    +    iterate over the list. If in the future, we replace the List with a
    +    different data structure, as long as it is enumerable, our view code
    +    will remain unchanged.
